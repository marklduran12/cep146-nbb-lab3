[Cookie Recipe](https://pinchofyum.com/the-best-soft-chocolate-chip-cookies)



1. Melt Your Butter: No guessing on the right consistency of butter (room temp? cold? chilled?) – you’re just going to melt it all the way through in the microwave and let it cool for just a few minutes.
2. Beat Butter and Sugars: Get it nice and fluffy and creamy.
3. Add Egg and Vanilla: Mix it just barely in (seriously, don’t beat that egg too hard!).
4. Mix In Dry Ingredients: Flour, baking soda, salt, the usual suspects.
5. Add Chocolate Chips: Duh!
6. Bake Cookies: Roll ’em up into balls and bake – but please, please, do not overbake. We want them to be just barely done for that soft melty deliciousness.
